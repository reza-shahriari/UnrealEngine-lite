    Version: 3.4.0
    Notes: This license had been approved previously, but we’re currently unable to locate a record of that approval. The team members involved in the original process are no longer with the company, which makes verification difficult. 
Now, we need an update because it has been moved from NotforLicencees to forLicencees

For clarity, the license in question is being used by MetaHuman within Unreal Engine, and not for MHC in the cloud.
