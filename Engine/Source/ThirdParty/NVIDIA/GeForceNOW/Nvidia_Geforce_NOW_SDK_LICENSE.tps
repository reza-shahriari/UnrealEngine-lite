documentation, installation routines and support files, sample art files and
assets, and supporting utilities to you (hereinafter referred to as “You”,
“Your” or “Licensee”) only on the condition that You accept all the terms in
this License Agreement ("Agreement").

IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL
ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE ENTITY TO
THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT.

IMPORTANT: READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS BEFORE USING THE
ACCOMPANYING NVIDIA GAMEWORKS LICENSED SOFTWARE.

BY CLICKING “ACCEPT” OR DOWNLOADING OR USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT, NVIDIA IS NOT WILLING TO LICENSE THE NVIDIA GAMEWORKS LICENSED
SOFTWARE TO YOU.    IF YOU  DO  NOT  AGREE  TO  THESE  TERMS,  DO NOT CLICK
“ACCEPT”.

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this
Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined throughout the Agreement and in
Section 12.9.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the obligations made and undertaken, the
parties covenant and agree as follows:

1.    License Grants.
1.1 License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, NVIDIA
hereby grants to You a limited, worldwide, personal, non-exclusive,
non-assignable, non-transferable, terminable, non-sublicensable (except as
provided below) paid-up license to:

(a) use, reproduce, display and perform the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software
or portions thereof, internally only solely as a reference for understanding
the functionality of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software and for purposes of
developing and integrating such NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software into Demos,
Expansion Packs, Games and/or other applications, for purposes of distribution
as set forth in (c) below;

(b) modify those portions of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software that are
provided in Source Code form solely (i) for purposes of compiling or
integrating the same or portions thereof as Object Code into Games, Expansion
Packs, Demos and other applications related to same, or (ii) to correct any
bugs or errors that You may identify in the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software,
each as subject to the further source code modification requirements as set
forth below;

(c) distribute the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software (including Source Code
Modifications that You make thereto) to third parties who are otherwise
separately licensed by NVIDIA to use such NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software
and have rights under its license to the same version of the NVIDIA GameWorks
Licensed Software that You are distributing, such licensees having the license
rights to such distributed Software as outlined in this Section 1.1 herein and
for no other purpose; and

(d) reproduce and distribute the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software, in Object
Code form only, solely as integrated into inseparable Games, Expansion Packs,
Demos and other applications on the Windows, Linux, OSX, iOS and Android
platforms (the “Authorized Platforms”) developed by You that incorporate the
NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software, subject to certain license procedures for
distribution of Games, Demos and other applications (including, for PC-based
titles, through use of a end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims
any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the
NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software), either by You or through Distributors
(subject to and as further detailed in Section 1.2 below). For the avoidance of
doubt, Your license rights under this Section 1.1(d) do not extend to platforms
other than the Authorized Platforms; use of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed
Software with platforms other than the Authorized Platforms requires entering
into a separate commercial license agreement with NVIDIA.

You are required to notify NVIDIA prior to use of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed
Software in the development of any commercial Game, Expansion Pack or Demo.
Please send notification by email to: gameworkslicensing@nvidia.com and provide
the following information in the email:

-     Company Name

-     Publisher and Developer Name

-     Game Title or Application Name

-     Platform (i.e. PC, Linux)

-     Scheduled Ship Date

-     WebLink to product/video

Failure to notify NVIDIA pursuant to this Section and failure to provide
attribution pursuant to Section 1.3 and Section 5 shall be considered a
material breach of this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under this Agreement to
integrate, embed or distribute the Source Code of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed
Software with Games, Expansion Packs, Demos and other applications, or to
distribute any part of the Object Code or Derivative Object Code of NVIDIA
GameWorks Licensed Software in stand-alone form (or provide functionality
allowing for the creation of standalone products utilizing the NVIDIA GameWorks
Licensed Software components).

In order to protect the integrity of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software,
You agree to the following with respect to modifications to the Source Code of
the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software (“Source Code Modifications”): (i) You
shall promptly notify NVIDIA of any proposed Source Code Modifications made in
order to correct bugs or errors, including a detailed description of the bug or
error that necessitated such modifications, and, upon NVIDIA’s request,
disclose such Source Code Modifications to NVIDIA; and (ii) You may otherwise
make Source Code Modifications to the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software,
provided that You must use best commercial efforts to not decrease the
performance of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software as incorporated into
Games, Demos, Expansion Packs and other applications as compared to
incorporation of such NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software in absence of such
Source Code Modifications. Any compilation of Source Code Modifications into
Object Code form by You is subject to the foregoing requirements.  The Source
Code Modifications in Object Code form and Source Code form will be further
subject to the licenses granted in Section 1.1(a)-(d), and You may use Source
Code Modifications solely as set forth in those licenses.  Any Source Code
Modifications will be owned by NVIDIA, and You assign to NVIDIA all right,
title and interest in and to same.  You may not allow access to, provide or
distribute the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software or Derivative Works thereof
(including any Source Code Modifications made by or for You) in Source Code
form to any third party except under the license rights set forth in Section
1.1(c) above.

1.2   Distributors.  You agree that any rights of Distributors to distribute
Games, Demos and other applications will only be granted pursuant to a written
agreement that (a) is at least as protective as the terms used by You to
protect its own proprietary software, and (b) provides no lesser protection for
the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software than the terms of this Agreement
(including, at minimum, the restrictions set forth in Section 1.3).  You will
be fully responsible for the performance of such Distributors in accordance
with this Agreement and applicable law.  You will take prompt and commercially
reasonable action at its expense to remedy any breach by its Distributors of
duties specified in this Agreement or violation of applicable law, including
terminating such Distributors' rights with respect to the NVIDIA GameWorks
Licensed Software.  You will notify NVIDIA in writing of any action by a
Distributor that gives rise to a breach of this Agreement and specify the
corrective action taken.  The execution of these duties by You will not
preclude NVIDIA from also taking corrective action.

1.3   Restrictions.  You will reproduce faithfully, and will require Your
Distributors to reproduce faithfully, all of NVIDIA's and its licensors'
copyright and proprietary notices on any copies You and its Distributors make
of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software, whether in Demos, Games or other
applications.  At minimum, You will acknowledge the copyrights of NVIDIA as
follows in the manual (if any) and in-game credits of any Game or Demo that
uses NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software or portions thereof (e.g. VisualFX SDK,
...).   "NVIDIA GameWorks™ Technology provided under license from NVIDIA
Corporation. Copyright © 2002-2015 NVIDIA Corporation. All rights reserved." or
such other similar statement as NVIDIA may reasonably require from time to
time. You agree that it will not:  (a) copy, modify, translate or otherwise
create any Derivative Works of any of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software,
except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (b) remove, alter, cover or
obscure any proprietary notice that appears on or with the NVIDIA GameWorks
Licensed Software or any copies thereof; (c) use the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed
Software or any Derivative Works thereof, or allow its use, transfer,
transmission or export in violation of any export control laws or regulations
administered by the United States government; (d) distribute, permit access to,
or sublicense the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software or any Derivative Works
thereof as a stand-alone product or without substantial value-added content or
(e) use the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software in any manner that would cause
the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software to become subject to an Open Source
License.  "Open Source License" includes, without limitation, a software
license that requires as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution
of such software that the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software be (i) disclosed
or distributed in source code form; (ii) be licensed for the purpose of making
derivative works; or (iii) be redistributable at no charge.

1.4   Third Party Software.  The NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software may contain
third party software components. If such third party software has separate
software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other
attribution requirements for such components can be found in the applicable
header files. By entering into this Agreement and using such third party
software, you are accepting the terms of such licenses. In such case, the third
party software terms will govern your use of the third party software, and will
take precedence over the terms of the Agreement for the third party software.
You agree that the owners of the third party software are intended third party
beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of third party
software.

2.    Feedback and Bug Reports.
If You provide NVIDIA information, suggestions and feedback regarding the
design or performance of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software (including the
reporting of bugs or errors through the relevant GitHub site) (collectively,
"Feedback"), You agree that NVIDIA is free to use such Feedback however it
chooses, including the unrestricted and irrevocable right to use, in NVIDIA's
sole discretion, as incorporated into its products, services and business.  If
You experience any bugs or failures relating to the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed
Software, You will immediately notify NVIDIA of such bugs or failures through
GitHub PhysX Issues.  You hereby assign to NVIDIA all right, title, and
interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property
rights) in that Feedback for all current and future methods and forms of
exploitation in any country. If any such rights are not effectively assigned
under applicable law, You hereby grant NVIDIA a non-exclusive, fully-paid,
irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute,
publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell,
import, modify and make Derivative Works based on, and otherwise exploit that
Feedback for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any
country. If any such rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable
law (such as moral and other personal rights), You hereby waive and agree not
to assert all such rights. However, You may continue to freely use any Feedback
that you provide to NVIDIA. You understand and agree that NVIDIA is not
required to make any use of any Feedback that you provide.

3.    Support.
NVIDIA does not have any support or update obligations with respect to the
NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software under this Agreement.

4.    Platform Licenses.
You represent and warrant that You have executed all necessary licenses with
console hardware manufacturers or other entities for the platforms for which
Games, Demos or other applications are developed.

5.    Marketing and Promotion.
5.1   Marketing Activities. The parties will engage in marketing activities as
follows:

(a).  Identification by You.  During the Term, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, NVIDIA agrees that You may identify NVIDIA on its
websites, printed collateral, trade-show displays and other retail packaging
materials, as an individual or company that supports the Game, provided that
all such references to NVIDIA will be subject to NVIDIA's prior review and
written approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b).  NVIDIA Trademark Placement in Games, Demos and other applications.  For
Games, Demos and other applications that incorporate NVIDIA GameWorks™ or
portions thereof, the NVIDIA logo must appear, on splash screens and on the
back cover of the instruction manual, if applicable, or similar placement in an
electronic file, at least in parity with other technology providers and IHV
partners.

(c). Marketing and Promotion by You.  You will include a reference to NVIDIA
GameWorks™ and NVIDIA in any of Your press releases for such Game that relate
to NVIDIA, and will identify NVIDIA as the provider of “NVIDIA GameWorks™” (or
such other term or phrase as indicated by NVIDIA from time to time).

(d). Identification by NVIDIA.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, You agree that NVIDIA may identify You, on NVIDIA's website, printed
collateral, trade-show displays and other retail packaging materials, as an
individual or entity that produces products and/or services which incorporate
the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software. To the extent that You provide NVIDIA
with input or usage requests with regard to the use of Licensee logo or
materials, NVIDIA will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such
requests.  For the avoidance of doubt, NVIDIA’s rights pursuant to this Section
5.1(d) shall survive any cancellation or termination of the Agreement with
respect to existing products and/or services which incorporate the NVIDIA
GameWorks Licensed Software.

(e). Game/Demo-related Marketing Material. You permit NVIDIA to create and
display self-promotional demo materials and use screenshot materials that
capture game assets from real-time game play, captured video clips and images
from the Game, after release of the Game to the public, and Licensee may also
provide NVIDIA with screenshots / imagery and video footage of the Game/Demo
representative of Licensee’s use of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software in
the Game (collectively, “Assets”). Licensee hereby grants to NVIDIA the right
to distribute, sub-license, and use the Assets in order to promote and market
the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software.  To the extent that You provide NVIDIA
with input or usage requests with regard to the use of Licensee logo or
materials, NVIDIA will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such
requests.  For the avoidance of doubt, NVIDIA’s rights pursuant to this Section
5.1(e) shall survive any cancellation or termination of the Agreement with
respect to Games, Demos and other applications which incorporate the NVIDIA
GameWorks Licensed Software.

5.2   Records and Audits.  You agree to keep accurate books and records related
to your use of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software, including the
development, manufacture, distribution, and sale of Games, Expansion Packs,
Demos, and other applications containing the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed
Software. NVIDIA will have the right, upon reasonable notice, during regular
business hours, through one or more legal, accounting, or technical third-party
auditors, which auditors will be bound by a confidentiality agreement equally
as protective as the confidentiality provisions in this Agreement, to inspect
Your records:  (a) to verify that use and distribution of NVIDIA GameWorks
Licensed Software by You is consistent with the material terms of this
Agreement; and (b) to ensure Your compliance with this Agreement.  You will
comply with all reasonable requests made in such inspection, including making
the appropriate personnel available to answer questions and provide copies of
relevant records.  The expense of such audit will be borne by NVIDIA.

6.    Intellectual Property Rights.
6.1   Ownership by NVIDIA.  NVIDIA and its licensors are the exclusive owners
of and hold all right, title and interest in and to the NVIDIA GameWorks
Licensed Software, and all portions of any Derivative Works thereof that

Information that NVIDIA provides to You under this Agreement, including all
Intellectual Property Rights in same.  In the event that You make any
modifications to the Source Code of the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software
pursuant to Section 1.1 above, You agree to assign, and hereby do assign to
NVIDIA, Your entire right, title, and interest in and to such modifications
including all Intellectual Property Rights therein.  You will take all
reasonably requested further actions and execute all documents reasonably
necessary to perfect NVIDIA's interests.

6.2   Ownership by You.  Subject to the rights of NVIDIA and its licensors in

is subject to compliance with the additional trademark use terms set forth in
the "NVIDIA Trademark and Guidelines" section below.  For the avoidance of
doubt, You will not and will not permit others to use any NVIDIA Mark in a way
that tarnishes, degrades, disparages or reflects adversely any of the NVIDIA
Marks or NVIDIA’s business or reputation, or that dilutes or otherwise harms
the value, reputation or distinctiveness of or NVIDIA’s goodwill in any NVIDIA
Mark.  In addition to the termination rights set forth in Section 11, NVIDIA
may immediately terminate this trademark license if You or, if applicable,
subcontractors, fail to comply with the NVIDIA's trademark terms and conditions
or otherwise fail to comply with the NVIDIA's directions about the use of the
marks.  You will follow NVIDIA's specifications for NVIDIA's Marks as to style,
color and typeface and submit a sample of each proposed use of NVIDIA's Marks
at least a one (1) weeks prior to the desired implementation of such use to
obtain NVIDIA's prior written approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).  If NVIDIA does not respond within ten (10) business days
of Your submission of such sample, the sample will be deemed unapproved.

8.    Confidentiality.
8.1   Obligations. Each party ("Receiving Party") agrees that all Confidential

employees and contractors who have a need to know for the purposes of this
Agreement, subject to such employees being bound in writing by confidentiality
obligations that are at least as protective of Discloser's rights as specified
in this Agreement.  The Receiving Party agrees to notify the Disclosing Party
in writing of any misuse, unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of the
Disclosing Party's Confidential Information immediately after the Receiving
Party becomes aware of any such misuse, unauthorized disclosure or
misappropriation. Nothing in this Agreement will affect any obligation of
either party to maintain the confidentiality of a third party’s confidential

NVIDIA TRADEMARKS AND GUIDELINES
NVIDIA Corporation Trademark License Terms

Terms with initial capitalization not defined herein are defined as set forth
in the Agreement.  Each party licensing the other party’s Marks is a “Mark
Licensee” hereunder, and each owner of Marks hereunder is an “Owner.”

1.    Marks.  The Marks are:

For NVIDIA (“NVIDIA Marks”):

NVIDIA®

PhysX®

NVIDIA® GameWorks™

For Company (“Company Marks”):

To be provided by Company

2.    Use of Marks.

2.1   The Company products with which the NVIDIA Marks may be used are those
with which the NVIDIA GameWorks Licensed Software may be used, as specified in
the Agreement (“Company Products”).  NVIDIA’s use of Company Marks is as
specified in the Agreement and Exhibit C (“Game Developer Program”).  Company
agrees that it will not make use of NVIDIA Marks in relation to any goods or
services other than the Company Products, and advertising and promotional
materials in support of such Company Products.  NVIDIA agrees that it will not
make use of Company Marks except as permitted in the Agreement.

2.2   Nothing herein will imply ownership of Marks different than that set out
in the Agreement.  All goodwill associated with each Mark Licensee’s use of
each Owner’s Mark will inure to the sole benefit of the Owner.

2.3   Each Mark Licensee agrees that it will comply with the terms set forth in
this Exhibit D and the trademark guidelines found in Appendices D-1 and D-2
(which each Owner may amend, upon reasonable written notice to the Mark
Licensee) with respect to such Mark Licensee’s use of the Owner’s Marks.

3.    Business Practices.  Each party covenants to the other party that it
will:

3.1   conduct its business with respect to the other party’s products in a
manner that reflects favorably at all times on the good name, goodwill and
reputation of such products;

3.2   avoid deceptive, misleading or unethical practices that are detrimental
to the other party, its customers, or end users;

3.3   make no false or misleading representations with regard to the other
party or its products; and

3.4   not publish or employ or cooperate in the publication or employment of
any misleading or deceptive advertising or promotional materials.

4.    No Combination Marks or Similar Marks.  Each Mark Licensee agrees not to
(a)combine any Owner’s Mark with any other content without the Owner’s prior
written approval, or (b) use any other trademark, trade name, or other
designation of source which creates a likelihood of confusion with the other
party’s Marks.

5.    No Harm to Marks.  Each party agrees that it will take such steps as are
reasonably necessary to ensure that neither it, nor any person under its
control (including its customers), will take or cause to be taken any action
that brings the other party or the other party’s Marks into disrepute.  Each
party agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, in any country or
governing body, apply to register in its own name, or otherwise attempt to
acquire any legal interest in or right in or to, any Mark of the other party.

6.    Notice Regarding Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.  Each
party agrees that if it becomes aware of any infringement or threatened
infringement of an Owner’s Marks, it will promptly notify the Owner.  Any legal
proceedings instituted by an Owner with respect to an infringement or
threatened infringement of any of its Marks will be conducted at such Owner’s
sole expense, provided that the Mark Licensee, if requested to do so, will
cooperate reasonably at the Owner’s expense in the conduct of such
proceedings.

7.    Trademark Unavailability.  In the event that a party’s Mark ceases to be
available for use with respect to the Agreement, the other party, as its sole
remedy, will be released (unless such unavailability arises due to the action
or inaction of that party) from any obligations to use such Mark unless and
until the same becomes available for use.

8.    Trademark Usage Guidelines.  Each party agrees that it will not use the
other party’s Marks other than as permitted by this Agreement and that it will
conform to the requirements of the other party with respect to such Marks
(including thorough compliance with the trademark usage guidelines attached
hereto at Appendices D-1 and D-2, and as such guidelines may be amended from
time to time) in relation to the use of the Marks and on associated
advertising, marketing and promotional materials.

9.    Quality; Audits.  Each party acknowledges and agrees that the Owner of
Marks will have the right to audit any relevant materials of the Mark Licensee
that use the Owner’s Marks from time to time to determine (a) whether or not
such use of the Owner’s Marks is in compliance with the terms of the Agreement
and this Exhibit D and (b) whether the Owner’s Marks are being used in
connection with products of sufficient quality such that the Owner’s Marks will
not suffer damage.  In the event that the Owner reasonably determines that the
Mark Licensee’s use of any of the Owner’s Marks or Combination Marks is not in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, or that due to reasonable quality
concerns, damage to the Owner’s Marks may occur, the Owner will provide written
notice to the Mark Licensee of same, which notice will describe in reasonable
detail the noncompliance.  A Mark Licensee receiving such notice will have 30
days to cure any noncompliance.  If the noncompliance is not cured in such time
frame, the Owner may suspend or terminate the Mark Licensee’s right to use the
affected Mark.
