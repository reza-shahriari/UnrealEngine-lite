* Subclass of PCG Blueprint Element, it comes with pre-configured pins as input and output for Dynamic meshes and force to be non-cacheable.
* The function CopyOrStealInputData is a helper to either steal (efficient) or copy the input data (less efficient) so work can be done in place on the Dynamic Mesh.
* More importantly, a user deriving from this class will want to implement ProcessDynamicMesh, the only thing needed to streamline the process and
* removes all the boilerplate when in a simple input->output case.
