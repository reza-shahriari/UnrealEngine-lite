/*
 * This file defines the Concert Protocol Tracing macros.
 * Unreal Insights does not understand it by default and we add extensions in the ConcertInsights plugin to visualize it.
 * 
 * The heart of Concert Protocol Tracing are sequences.
 * A sequence consists of actions that are performed by multiple endpoints.
 * Example of a sequence:
 *  - Every frame, client 1 collects data to replicate and sends it to the server.
 *  - The server enqueues the data and sends it to client 2.
 *  - Client 2 applies the data.
 * Sequences are associated with a EProtocolSuite and grouped accordingly by the ConcertInsights extension.
 *
 * For now there is only one type of trace: traced objects. See CONCERT_TRACE_OBJECT_ Macros.
 * These associate actions with an object and a sequence ID, which groups together related changes.
 * For example, in the context of replication a single frame's data being sent across the clients gets a single sequence ID:
 *	- client 1 could trace a. how long it takes to serialize the data and then b. how long to compress it.
 *	- the server could trace how long it takes to process the data
 *	- client 2 could trace a. how long it apply the data to the UObject
 *	
 * ConcertInsights visualizes networking transport times.
 * Transmission starts with CONCERT_TRACE_OBJECT_TRANSMISSION_START and ends with CONCERT_TRACE_OBJECT_TRANSMISSION_RECEIVE.
 * 
 * TODO DP: We might want to add CONCERT_TRACE_OBJECT_SEND and CONCERT_TRACE_OBJECT_RECEIVE macros to be explicit about sending and receiving.
 * 
 * Every endpoint writes to its own .utrace file and must be in context of a session ID (i.e. clients are in a session, server is told which session is being traced).
 * When beginning to trace, the first event sent to the .utrace files is CONCERT_TRACE_INIT, which sets data needed to aggregate the .utrace files, such as endpoint IDs.
 * Finally, ConcertInsights aggregates the .utrace files in the UI. The related .utrace files are grouped by SessionID, which Unreal Insights saves
 * in the file by reading the -tracesessionguid command line; CONCERT_TRACE_INIT associates the .utrace file with the client / server endpoint ID.
 * ConcertInsightsSynchronizedTrace implements synchronized recording.
