/**
 * Utility class designed to allow tbe baking of the resources of a target Mutable Customizable Object instance onto disk.
 *
 * The actual baking operation does require some work done before the baking itself.
 *		- Updating of the instance (async) : The mutable COInstance gets updated prior to the bake to make sure the instance resources to bake are the latest
 *		- Baking of the instance resources (sync) : The resources of the instance get baked onto disk.
 *
 * Once the whole operation gets completed a callback gets executed (OnBakeOperationCompletedCallback) that will provide the caller with the bake operation result
 * (true for success and false for failure) and a list of asset paths that got saved onto disk.
 *
 * Since the update of the instance for baking requires of some static changes in the instance updating system so the parallel update of instances
 * for baking is not allowed. This prohibition is enforced by the update methods that we call prior to the baking operation. No more than one update for baking can
 * be run at the same time.
