/**
    @brief
        Implementation of object detection algorithm which is an extension of basic
        checkerboard pattern detection, to handle detection of multiple patterns in
        one image, assuming that each pattern is unique. Implemented pipeline for
        detecting multiple chessboard patterns on image is as follows: First, we sort
        possible patterns, by dimensions, in decreasing order, from largest to smallest.
        Next, we apply standard algorithm for chessboard pattern detection aiming at
        detecting first pattern with largest dimension. In case of detection, we write
        detected points, and mask area of detected pattern on image. In next iteration,
        In the next iteration, the algorithm for checkerboard pattern detection is
        applied on masked image, and it aims at detecting second largest pattern.
        If the pattern is not detected, this iteration is skipped. The algorithm
        iterates to the last ï¿½ smallest possible pattern. With this procedure, we avoid
        possible false detection of a small dimension pattern in a large one.
