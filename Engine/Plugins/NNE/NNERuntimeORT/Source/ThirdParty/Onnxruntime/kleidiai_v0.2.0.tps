    Notes: The onnxruntime library consists of header files and dynamically linked libraries of which this software is part of. Both headers and shared libraries will be added and used in the engine. While the headers are compiled into the standalone application, the dynamic libraries are distributed along with it. The software is thus used internally, by licensees as well as end consumers.
